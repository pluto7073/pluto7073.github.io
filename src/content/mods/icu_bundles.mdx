A mod that backports the features of Bundles of Bravery (1.21.2) to 1.20.1.

## Backported Features
- New Bundle UI
- Item Selection within Bundle
- Durability bar of bundle turns red when full
- Dyable bundles
- Updated bundle recipe
- Bundle Feature is now enabled by default so enabling it on world creation is not required

## Differences
- Bundle textures remain unchanged
- Selected item will be selected until an item is either removed or added to the bundle, at which point it will be reset
- When you scroll the bundle selection in the creative inventory it also scrolls the current tab (bug?)
- Colored bundles can be found in the search tab

## Notes for Updating
If you decide to update to 1.21.2+, un-dye your bundles first (place the bundle in a crafting table), as any items contained in a colored bundle will be lost upon updating, despite the colored bundles technically being "vanilla" items

## Forge Version?
I lack the time, attention span, and patience to learn an entirely new modloader
