Spill that tea with Pluto's Tea Time

With this installment of the Pluto's Drinks series, you can embark on the long and
complicated process of creating Tea in Minecraft.  Enjoy such activities as growing
tea leaves, wilting and fermenting tea leaves, and creating various types of tea
with numerous beneficial effects.
